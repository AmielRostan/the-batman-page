                        The character of Batman originated in 1939 when he was created by
                        Bob Kane and Bill Finger. He was conceived as a response to the
                        success of Superman, the first superhero, with a darker and more
                        detective-oriented approach. Inspired by characters like Zorro and
                        The Shadow, Batman is the alter ego of Bruce Wayne, a billionaire
                        who vowed to avenge his parents' death and fight crime in Gotham
                        City. His creation marked the beginning of the Golden Age of comics
                        and laid the foundation for the emergence of an iconic character
                        that has endured over the years in comics, movies, TV series, and
                        other media.

                    <p>
                        Batman's true identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy philanthropist
                        and the heir to the Wayne family fortune. He leads a double life,
                        using his vast resources to fund his crime-fighting activities as
                        Batman. Wayne's motivation to become the Caped Crusader stems from
                        witnessing the murder of his parents as a child, which instilled in
                        him a deep desire for justice and a commitment to protecting Gotham
                        City from crime and corruption. His dual identity allows him to
                        navigate the criminal underworld while maintaining the façade of a
                        billionaire playboy during the day.
